# Stress-Detection-Project---Incedo

Stress, anxiety, and depression are major mental health issues affecting many people. Individuals often share their struggles on social media platforms like Instagram and Reddit. Recently, content creators and organizations have started using machine learning to detect stress in social media posts to provide timely help. This project aims to use Python to detect stress in social media posts with machine learning. The project takes a text input from the user and then predicts whether the statement shows signs of stress or not.
